# This script sums payment spent by Rockbuster customers in each country and shows the best 10 countries. To join the country with payments 5 tables need to be joined: A customer, B adress, C city, D country and E payment.
SELECT country
       COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS customer_count
       SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON a.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_payment DESC
LIMIT 10;
